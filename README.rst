SMPTE ST 2042-2 (VC-2) Constants and Data Tables
================================================

**This repository is a work-in-progress.**

This Python package, ``vc2_data_tables``, contains machine-readable versions of
the constants and data tables in the SMPTE ST 2042-series of standards relating
to the `VC-2 professional video codec
<https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/vc-2>`_. It also includes software routines
for computing useful data including:

* Quantisation matrices for arbitrary wavelet configurations
* Bit-width requirements for encoder and decoder implementations
* Adverserial test patterns for encoders and decoders
