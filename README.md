SMPTE ST 2042-1 (VC-2) Constants and Data Tables
================================================

This Python package, `vc2_data_tables`, contains machine-readable versions of
the constants and data tables in the SMPTE ST 2042-series of standards relating
to the [VC-2 professional video codec](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/vc-2).


Work in progress...
-------------------

This software is being produced as part of an effort to develop conformance
testing software for implementations of the SMPTE ST 2042-1 (VC-2) standard.

This software is currently a work in progress.  Contact [Jonathan
Heathcote](mailto:jonathan.heathcote@bbc.co.uk) or [John
Fletcher](mailto:john.fletcher@bbc.co.uk) for more information.
