Predefined Data Table CSVs
==========================

The Excel-compatible CSV files in this directory are read by
``vc2_data_tables/__init__.py``. These files define many of the larger tables
of values in the ST 2042-2 document and may be used directly, rather than via
this Python module, if desired.

See the documentation for details of the formatting conventions used in these
files.
